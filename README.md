# sort-last
When given a list of non-empty tuples, a list is returned sorted in increasing order by the last element in each tuple


# For Example:

  When the function sort_last(tuples) is called, where tuples is [(1, 7), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (2, 2)]
    
    
      This yields [(2, 2), (1, 3), (3, 4, 5), (1, 7)]
      
      
Python 2.7 was used during the creation of the function;
